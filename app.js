//git
// git is a version control system used to track changes in your files. Used most notably by developers.
//Git commits are checksumed using SHA-1, meaning no corrupt files go unnoticed without user's knowledge.
//git has three states
// - modified
// file changed, but it has not yet been committed (ex: normal work, or saving a file)
// - staging
